# project_twitter
Pull stuff useful for weight management from twitter.
This project is suspended until I decide what to do about my twitter privacy.
My first iteration was to base an implementation on the approach documented in a coding rainbow youtube video.
While this worked to the extent that I was able to print tweets containing a keyword specified via a "q" parameter in the code. I was not able to print my own tweets, possibly due to a privacy setting.
The basic process is to exit the "p5 server" that will likely be running in a terminal window, then "cd" to the "project twitter" subdirectory of the "collections" folder, then run "node bot.js".
